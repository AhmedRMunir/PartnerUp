## Open Issues:
- If you log in with the wrong email domain, you're locked out of the website unless you clear cookies/use private browsing
- Testing Suite is not comprehensive. Can not test database calls due to Jest incompatibility with ES6
- Gradle doesn't work as intended, therefore removed from the user manual. 
  - Need to accommodate for different use cases across Windows and Mac
